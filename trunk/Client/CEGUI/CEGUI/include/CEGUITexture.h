\brief
	Abstract base class specifying the required interface for Texture objects.

	Texture objects are created via the Renderer.  The actual inner workings of any Texture object
	are dependant upon the Renderer (and underlying API) in use.  This base class defines the minimal
	set of functions that is required for the rest of the system to work.  Texture objects are only
	created through the Renderer object's texture creation functions.
