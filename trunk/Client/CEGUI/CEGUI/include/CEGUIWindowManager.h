\brief
	The WindowManager class describes an object that manages creation and lifetime of Window objects.

	The WindowManager is the means by which Window objects are created and destroyed.  For each sub-class
	of Window that is to be created, there must exist a WindowFactory object which is registered with the
	WindowFactoryManager.  Additionally, the WindowManager tracks every Window object created, and can be
	used to access those Window objects by name.
