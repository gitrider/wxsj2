
This file contains a list of todo items for the PCZSceneManager plugin.
Some items are specific, some are not, it's just a list to keep notes for myself.


KNOWN BUGS:
-------------
* Light traversal is not quite correct.  In order to avoid infinite recursion, I had to
  put in a hack which can potentially result in light not traversing into some zones properly.
  It will probably not be noticeable in most situations, but could potentially show up in
  very complex portal/zone setups.
* Deleting a Zone and then recreating will cause problems if PCZSceneNodes are still referencing the original deleted zone

TODO:
-------------
* If a Zone is deleted, scan all the SceneNodes and remove matching ZoneData
* PCZTestApp (and all PCZSM apps?) currently requires linking to the PCZ import library - it shouldn't.
* PCZ .dll does not load (init) properly unless it's in the same directory as the executable.
* Allow portals to connect to the same zone they are in
* Test function to prevent scenenodes from crossing portals which they won't fit through
* More testing 


OPTIMIZATIONS (todo):
---------------------
* OctreeZone - utilize octree when determining portal visibility (currently does 
  separate check not accelerated by octree) for both cameras and light frustums).
* Add scissor rects for portals which are fully visible (i.e. all 4 sides)
* TerrainZoneRenderable has a function for intersecting segments.  Maybe (?) able to
  use my Ogre::Segment class instead of Ray?
