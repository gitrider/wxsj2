            in terms of the operations required. This method returns the

            length but before the square root is taken. Use this if you
            want to find the longest / shortest vector without incurring
            the square root.

        @remarks
            The dot product can be used to calculate the angle between 2
            vectors. If both are unit vectors, the dot product is the
            cosine of the angle; otherwise the dot product must be
            divided by the product of the lengths of both vectors to get
            the cosine of the angle. This result can further be used to
            calculate the distance of a point from a plane.
        @param
            vec Vector with which to calculate the dot product (together
            with this one).

        @remarks
            The cross-product is normally used to calculate the normal
            vector of a plane, by calculating the cross-product of 2
            non-equivalent vectors which lie on the plane (e.g. 2 edges
            of a triangle).
        @param
            vec Vector which, together with this one, will be used to
            calculate the cross-product.
        @returns
            A vector which is the result of the cross-product. This
            vector will <b>NOT</b> be normalised, to maximise efficiency
            - call PS_Vector3::normalise on the result if you wish this to
            be done. As for which side the resultant vector will be on, the
            returned vector will be on the side from which the arc from 'this'
            to rkVector is anticlockwise, e.g. UNIT_Y.crossProduct(UNIT_Z)
            = UNIT_X, whilst UNIT_Z.crossProduct(UNIT_Y) = -UNIT_X.
			This is because OGRE uses a right-handed coordinate system.
        @par
            For a clearer explanation, look a the left and the bottom edges
            of your monitor's screen. Assume that the first vector is the
            left edge and the second vector is the bottom edge, both of
            them starting from the lower-left corner of the screen. The
            resulting vector is going to be perpendicular to both of them
            and will go <i>inside</i> the screen, towards the cathode tube
            (assuming you're using a CRT monitor, of course).
