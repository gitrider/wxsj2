Welcome to \ctname, the easy way to configure wxWidgets.
Instead of tweaking a setup.h file, or typing a long configure
command, you can now check and uncheck options in a convenient
GUI tool, read the relevant reference document for each
option, and save the setup.h file or configure command file.

\chapter{Installation}%
\setheader{{\it Installation}}{}{}{}{}{{\it Installation}}%
\setfooter{\thepage}{}{}{}{}{\thepage}%

{\bf On Windows:}

Please run the installation program. This will create a program
folder called \ctname (or other name if you have chosen a different name). This
folder can be accessed via the Start menu under Programs. The
folder contains shortcuts to the program, help file, and Uninstall program.

You can uninstall \ctshortname either by double-clicking the Uninstall \ctshortname icon
in the \ctname group, or by invoking the Windows Control Panel,
double-clicking on Add/Remove Programs, and then choosing the \ctshortname item.

{\bf On Linux:}

Unarchive wxconfigtool-x.xx.tar.gz to a suitable location
in your filesystem. A directory of the form wxconfigtool-x.xx
(where x.xx is the version number) will be created.

Add the location to your PATH and run the application with
'wxconfigtool'. You may wish to set the environment variable
WXCONFIGTOOLDIR so that wxWidgets Configuration Tool can find its data files.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
  % cd ~
  % tar xvfz wxconfigtool-1.01.tar.gz
  % export WXCONFIGTOOLDIR=`pwd`/wxconfigtool-1.01
  % export PATH=$PATH:$WXCONFIGTOOLDIR
  % wxconfigtool
\end{verbatim}

If you don't want to change your PATH, you could place a
script in a location already on your PATH, such as
/usr/local/bin. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
  #!/bin/sh
  # Invokes wxWidgets Configuration Tool
  export WXCONFIGTOOLDIR=/home/mydir/wxconfigtool-1.01
  $WXCONFIGTOOLDIR/wxconfigtool $*
\end{verbatim}

{\bf On Mac:}

Download and unarchive the HQX file, and drag the wxWidgets Configuration Tool folder to an appropriate location
on your hard disk. Then double-click on the 'wxconfigtool' executable.

\end{itemize}

{\bf Version 1.01, June 14th 2003}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=10pt
\item Added Find facility.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Version 1.0, June 11th 2003}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=10pt
\item Initial version.
\end{itemize}

\section{Known issues}\label{knownissues}

The following problems are known to exist:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=10pt
\item No issues as yet.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}\label{todo}

There are many things that could be done to make
this tool more useful, including the following.

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=10pt
\item Allow full platform-specific dependency specification
as mentioned in \helpref{How to specify platform-specific dependencies}{platformdependencies}.
\item Allow \ctshortname to invoke configure and make, with an output
window showing build status.
\item Distinguish between template files and settings file; allow
application of template files to settings files, and vice versa.
\item Implement support for string, integer, float settings.
\item Write a configuration browser.
\item Add description, date and author information to the settings file.
\item Command-line mode with ability to change settings from
the command-line. Just like configure :-)
\item Decide on standard location for settings files.
\item Integrate with new (and old?) build systems.
\item Allow customization of font and colour.
\item Show all calculated dependencies for each config item.
\item Add a search facility.
\end{itemize}

\section{Differences between Windows, Linux and Mac versions}\label{platformdifferences}

Although every effort has been made to make wxWidgets Configuration Tool work
the same way on different environments, some small differences
are inevitable.

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=10pt
\item Screenshots illustrate the Windows version; the Linux
and Mac windows and dialogs will be slightly different, but with equivalent
functionality.
\item Dialogs under Windows often have a '?' button on the title
bar, for context-sensitive help. Under Linux, this button is
on the dialog itself, usually near the OK or Close button.
On the Mac, context-sensitive help is not yet supported.
\item Under Linux, online help invoked from the {\bf Help} button
in modal dialogs is itself modal. That is, you have to quit
the help window to return to the dialog. On Windows, you can
switch back to the dialog without quitting the help viewer.
\item On Windows and Linux, context menus are invoked with
right-click. On Mac, use control-click.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{\ctshortname user interface}\label{documentui}%
\setheader{{\it CHAPTER \thechapter}}{}{}{}{}{{\it CHAPTER \thechapter}}%
\setfooter{\thepage}{}{}{}{}{\thepage}%

This section describes the main elements of the \ctname user interface.

The \ctshortname main window looks like this:

\begin{center}
\image{}{screen01.png}
\end{center}

\section{Menubar}

%\image{}{menubar.gif}

The \helpref{menubar}{menubarcommands} allows you to perform many functions
such as loading and saving files, creating new configuration items,
undo/redo, invoking help, and so on. Try to remember the keyboard shortcuts that are
displayed next to the menu item labels - they can save you a lot of time
and make your \ctshortname experience more natural and enjoyable.

\section{Main toolbar}

%\image{}{toolbar.gif}

The main toolbar gives quick access to commonly-used commands.
If you hold your mouse pointer over the toolbar buttons, a tooltip pops up with a short description
of the button's function.

You can choose to hide the toolbar altogether
using the {\bf View | Show Toolbar} menu command.

You can find out more about in the \helpref{toolbar commands}{toolbarcommands} topic.

\section{Configuration window}

%\image{}{configwindow.gif}

The biggest area of \ctshortname is taken up by the configuration window.

On the left is a hierarchy of settings that can be customized.
You can check and uncheck most settings, but you will find that
many settings are disabled because they depend on other settings
being enabled (or disabled).

As an end user, you will probably only want to enable or disable
options, but it's possible you may wish to update the structure
of the settings file itself. In which case you can use the
{\bf Edit} menu to add, remove, or rename items; and you can
add custom properties to an item, but this is usually only
useful for a developer of the tool to do.

Undo/Redo can be applied to most editing commands, but (currently) not
enabling and disabling operations.

There are three tabs in the main window: {\bf Properties}, {\bf Setup.h},
and {\bf Configure}. The Properties tab contains the properties
for the selected option. Setup.h shows the setup file,
and there are buttons to allow you to copy the file to the clipboard
and regenerate the file. Similarly, the Configure tab shows
the script that will invoke configure.

The property editor allows you to show detailed information
about the option. A description for each property is shown
when you click on the property. You can also edit property values,
either by clicking and typing, or by double-clicking or clicking
on the {\bf Edit...} button. If a special editor is defined for
the property type, it will be shown.

You can invoke help for the selected option, by clicking
on the question mark toolbar button or the {\bf Help | Configuration Item Help} menu
item. If there is a help topic defined for the option, the
wxWidgets reference manual will be opened at that topic.

Congratulations! You have learnt how to create, edit, save, and load configuration
files.

To get to know \ctshortname more thoroughly, here are some further things you
can do.

\begin{itemize}
\item Read the \helpref{How To}{howto} section.
\item Use the help facilities: most dialogs have a {\bf Help} button for a general description, and they
also have a {\bf "?"} button for getting information on individual controls on a dialog.
\item Explore the menubar and the menus that appear when you right-click over
the window background and individual cards.

\chapter{Reference}\label{reference}%

\section{The dependency evaluation algorithm}

\ctshortname pre-calculates a list of all dependencies
for each option -- this is a kind of reverse-pointer version
of all the dependencies associated with each item. So
if option {\bf a} has a {\bf requires} option specifying
{\bf b}, then {\bf b} will end up with a dependency list
containing {\bf a} and any other options that refer to it.

When the user enables or disables an option ({\bf b}),
the list of dependencies for that option is visited,
and for each mentioned option ({\bf a}), all its dependency information
is evaluated. This may result in the option {\bf a} being
(de)selected and perhaps deactivated (made insensitive).

The results of this change are propagated to dependents of
{\bf a}, recursively, so several options may flip state
as the result of checking the original option.

The parent-child relationship of a check or radio
group and its children is considered to be a virtual
'requires' dependency. Mutual exclusivity is also
taken into account if the option is a radio option
or group. For each radio option, all other mutually
exclusive options need to be listed. See the
{\bf Target} group for an example of this.

The results of these dependencies can be overridden by
indeterminate-if, which is done last of all and can
make the option user-selectable when otherwise it
would be constrained to be enabled or disabled.

\section{How \ctshortname generates the configure commands}

If the {\bf configure} property isn't empty,
\ctshortname will output the string as a parameter
to configure.

The configure command is taken to be the command to
use if the option is checked. If the option is
unchecked, the 'enable' or 'with' is replaced with
'disable' or 'without'.

TODO: should we distinguish between the case
where a setting is not passed to configure (using
the default), versus the case where it's specified but disabled?
It's probably a good idea to make all the options
explicit, but on the other hand it makes for a very long
command line.

\ctshortname checks for the presence of a
{\bf builtin} custom boolean property and appends 'builtin' or
'sys' to the configure command depending on where
the {\bf builtin} setting is checked or unchecked.
We also allow for passing strings, e.g. for --with-rpath=DIR,
by using the {\bf value} custom string property.

\section{How \ctshortname generates the setup.h file}

The {\bf Target} group is ignored. In all other
cases, if the setting is prefixed by wxUSE_...
and it's a boolean setting, \ctshortname will
output 1 or 0 depending on the setting state.

A few settings that don't have the wxUSE_...
convention are also checked for and processed.

A variety of topics to help you get the best from \ctshortname.

\section{How to specify dependencies}\label{dependencies}

To ensure consistency throughout the configuration,
\ctshortname allows specification of dependencies, essentially
a list of option names that should be considered in evaluating
whether an option should be enabled or disabled. In addition,
if the option is constrained to always be disabled
or enabled in the current context, then it is greyed out
(deactivated) to prevent the user from changing the state.

There are five kinds of dependencies: requires, precludes,
enabled-if, enabled-if-not, and indeterminate-if. Each one represents a
relationship between the current option (a) and one
or more named options (b). For the sake of argument
we will consider only one other option, but multiple
options are taken to mean (b1 or b2 or b3 or ...)
Below the allowed combined states of a and b are
listed for each kind of dependency.

1. a {\bf requires} b

For example, wxUSE_DRAG_AND_DROP requires wxUSE_OLE.

\begin{verbatim}
    a        b

    1        1
    0        1
    0        0
\end{verbatim}

2. a {\bf precludes} b

For example, wxUSE_ODBC precludes wxUSE_UNICODE.

\begin{verbatim}
    a        b

    1        0
    0        0
    0        1
\end{verbatim}


3. a {\bf enabled-if} b

For example, __WXUNIVERSAL__ enabled-if X11 or MGL

\begin{verbatim}
    a        b

    1        1
    1        0
    0        0
\end{verbatim}

4. a {\bf enabled-if-not} b

For example, wxUSE_TOOLBAR_SIMPLE enabled-if-not wxUSE_TOOLBAR_NATIVE.

\begin{verbatim}
    a        b

    1        0
    0        1
    1        1
\end{verbatim}

5. a {\bf indeterminate-if} b

For example, wxUSE_UNICODE indeterminate-if Custom.

\begin{verbatim}
    a        b

    ?        1
\end{verbatim}

This overrides all the other dependencies, and allows you
to make an option user-choosable in some circumstances,
when otherwise it would be constrained to be either enabled or
disabled. You may need to use an intermediate option to
make sensible use of this: for example make the intermediate
option dependent on a number of factors, such as Unicode not being
available on some platforms.

\section{How to specify platform-specific dependencies}\label{platformdependencies}

You can associate one or more options as part of the
option's {\bf context}. In the case of wxUSE_OLE,
the context contains __WXMSW__, because it's a Windows-specific
option. This is used when calculating dependencies, as
follows. If either option involved in a dependency
relationship is not part of the current context, that
is, none of the options in its {\bf context} property is currently
enabled, then it is ignored in the dependency calculation.

This allows the dependency 'wxUSE_DRAG_AND_DROP requires wxUSE_OLE'
to only be evaluated when __WXMSW__ is enabled.

It doesn't quite cover all bases, however, because
it cannot express that the {\it dependency} itself
is platform specific. You might have a platform-specific
dependency that exists between two options that are
perfectly valid for any platform. For example, we
can't capture the notion that wxUSE_LISTBOX
should be required if wxUSE_COMBOBOX is set,
but only for __WXUNIVERSAL__. We could do it
by complicating the dependency syntax, for example:

wxUSE_COMBOBOX requires wxUSE_LISTBOX:__WXUNIVERSAL__

This means that the dependency should only be
evaluated if __WXUNIVERSAL__ is enabled.
This has not been implemented yet.

\section{How to specify custom properties}\label{customproperties}

You can add custom properties to any option, but
currently only {\bf option} and {\bf value} are
recognised by \ctshortname.

\ctshortname checks for the presence of a
{\bf builtin} boolean custom property and appends 'builtin' or
'sys' to the configure command depending on where
the {\bf builtin} setting is checked or unchecked.
We also allow for passing strings, e.g. for --with-rpath=DIR,
by using the {\bf value} string custom property.
