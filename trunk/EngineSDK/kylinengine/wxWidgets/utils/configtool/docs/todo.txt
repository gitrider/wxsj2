TODO
====

Note: some tasks can be done by others
once in CVS.

Essential
=========

- make decent example from setup.h

- allow for string, integer settings

- Settings dialog

- generate setup.h, configure commands

- distinguish between configurations settings
  and configuration template files

- configuration browser

- ability to invoke make after configuration

- how about running samples, giving size
  information (possibly writing to file)

- command-line mode: could write configure command
  to standard output, with optional make invocation

- decide on a standard location for .wxs files in
  wxWin hierarchy, so tool can find files automatically.

- makefiles for other systems

- setup and tarball generation

- documentation

Nice-to-have
============

- incorporate makefile/project generator
  for independent apps

- possibly evolve it into a central command
  centre for wxWidgets: invoke other apps such
  as poEdit, <favourite dialog editor>, help,
  wizards, etc. Upgrade your wxWin version
  via the web.
