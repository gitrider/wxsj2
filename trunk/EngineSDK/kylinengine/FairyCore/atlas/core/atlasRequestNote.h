/// chunk, but who they are and what their current priority for it is.
///
/// To reconcile all of this book-keeping in order to determine a final
/// priority, as well as a "yea/nay" for keeping the resource paged in,
/// involves enough work we break it into its own helper class.

/// numbers of terrain instances. For more complex scenarios, a linked list
/// might not be enough, and may need to be replaced with a hash or map.
