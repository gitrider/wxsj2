    KNOWN BUGS
    ==========

    [Common]
    - Showing a wxDockWindow using the in-built menu does not always put the window back in the expected position
    - Through the docking action, a wxDockWindow can get a smaller docked-proportion than the minimum
    - Context menu request (wxSlideBar) should be ignore for "text" widgets (i.e. wxTextCtrl, wxComboBox, ..)
    [wxMSW]
    - wxToolButton can get 'keyboard focus'
    - Docked wxDockWindows are not having their non-client area painted in some cases
    [wxGTK]
    - wxDockWindow appears in task window until docked and undocked (maybe bug in wxWidgets)
    - wxDockwindow resize request sometimes ignored (usually if mouse still moving on left mouse button release)
    - Various screen draw problems with wxDockWindow and wxExSplitter
    - Key-Up event to release 'block docking' mode (wxDockWindow) not occuring
    - Double-Click event on the header gripper not occuring when wxDockWindow is undocked 
     (event occurs correctly when docked)
    - Rotated text looks poor (maybe bug in wxWidgets)
    - Undocked windows do not get correctly positioned on layout restore
    - Docked window layout is not correct on layout restore (although is corrected on next layout event)
