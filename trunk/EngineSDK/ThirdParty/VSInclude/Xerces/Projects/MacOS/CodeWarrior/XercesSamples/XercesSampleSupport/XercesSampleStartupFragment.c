/*
	The code in this file should be compiled into your Metrowerks Runtime PPC code.
	The net result will be that you can build generic unix-style C code without
	Macintosh modifications to setup argc/argv. The Xerces sample projects expect
	this modification.
	
	To use:
	
		- Add the code below to your Metrowerks Startup.c file (in runtime libraries)
		- Rebuild the various targets of project MSL All.mcp.
		- In the PPC Linker section of your project, set the start code to be
		  __start_ccommand instead of the typical __start. This will cause ccommand
		  to be invoked before main() is started.
		  
	This code has been submitted as a suggestion to Metrowerks: hopefully they'll
	add it to the startup code so this modification won't always be necessary.
	
	!!!NOTE!!!
	
	If the above seems too odious for your needs, you may also modify the "main" file
	of each sample by adding a line such as the following near the start of the main()
	function:
	
		argc = ccommand(&argv);

	This will invoke the command line dialog manually.

 *	This routine should be specified as the PEF main routine in the container

 *  The program startup/termination sequence is:
 *
 *	1.	Register the exception-handling info for the application
 *	2.	Call all static initializers
 *	3.	Call ccommand to set up default values for 'argc' and 'argv' and call main()
 *	4.	Call exit() to perform required cleanup and termination, including
