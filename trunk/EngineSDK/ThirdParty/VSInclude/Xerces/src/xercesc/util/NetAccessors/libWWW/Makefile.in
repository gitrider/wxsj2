# Enabling libWWW NetAccessor support under UNIX. Tested with latest tarball of libWWW
# (w3c-libwww-5.3.2) under RedHat Linux 6.1.  Added by Martin Kalen.
#
# There is one MAJOR problem with the use of libwww and the patches
# below, which someone with knowledge of libwww filters etc. might want
# to look into. Default behavior for content-type text/xml is to consume
# all xml data before it reaches the simple HTML presenter. Hence, only
# files with content-type text/html will actually reach the xerces-c
# library. If you have a *.xml file on the webbserver, processing of the
# file will throw an exception stating "The main XML document cannot be
# empty" (correct in a xerces point of view since if you enable debug
# build you will see that libwww "eats" all text/xml).
#
# See "Diffs for enabling libWWW NetAccessor support under UNIX" posted in March 1, 2001
# in the xerces-c-dev mailing list for further information.
